    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 beef sirloin steak</li>
        <li>1/2 cup gluten-free soy sauce (tamari)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coconut oil</li>
        <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons miso paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 packages ramen noodles</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Combine steak and soy sauce in a plastic container with a lid. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook until firm and reddish-pink and juicy
            in the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side. AN instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F

            bring to a boil. Once broth is at a slow boil, add ramen noodles. COok until noodles are soft, about 3 minutes. Season to taste
            with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer broth and noodle to 2 bowls. Slice steak and place on top</li>
